    "summary": "I am Jordi, a highly skilled data enthusiast with a passion for leveraging technology to solve complex business problems.\\n I am passionate about programming, cryptocurrencies, data, stock market analysis and videogames.\\n I earned my degree in Business Administration from the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona and furthered my education with a master’s degree in Financial Management from the renowned Universitat Pompeu Fabra.\\n To augment my expertise, I completed the Ironhack bootcamp, where I emerged as the winner of the first edition of the IronDatathon an in-class competition akin to Kaggle contests.\\n During my time at Ironhack, I honed my skills in Python, SQL, Scikit-learn, Pandas, SciPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and various other Python libraries.\\n My experience extends to Kido Dynamics, where I served as a Data Scientist, gaining valuable knowledge in GeoPandas, Airflow, Superset, AWS, and developing cutting-edge algorithms related to geometries. I also developed a population model and conducted innovative geovisualizations with Folium and Mplleaflet.\\n I took two years off to further improve my programming skills and expanded my expertise into front-end development. During this time, I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node, which has significantly broadened my technical abilities and understanding of full-stack development.\\n I am eager to take on new challenges and opportunities, and I am actively seeking a Data Scientist & Software Engineer role where I can contribute my skills and expertise to a dynamic team. I am open to positions both domestically and internationally.\\n I am confident that my broad experience and skills make me a valuable addition to any team.\\n Please do not hesitate to contact me for additional information.",

      "summary": "Lockdowns, both total and perimetral, were the most effective nonpharmaceutical interventions against COVID-19 but also had significant socioeconomic impacts. Decision-makers struggled with predicting the appropriate level of restrictions due to the lack of immediate data on their effects.\\n The radius of gyration, derived from mobile phone data of over 13 million users in Spain, aggregates key aspects of human mobility into a sensitive metric that predicts COVID-19 death trends with a three-week offset.\\n Analysis showed that when the radius of gyration exceeds 70% of its pre-pandemic level, COVID-19 deaths increase three weeks later, and conversely, deaths decrease when the radius is below this threshold, suggesting it as a reliable predictor and indicating that partial mobility restrictions can be as effective as total lockdowns."
